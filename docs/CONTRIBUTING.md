# üõ†Ô∏è Building from Source

Learn how to build Mindful from source.

## Prerequisites

1. **Set Up Flutter Environment**:

   - Follow the official Flutter installation guide for your platform: [Flutter Installation Guide](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install).

2. **Update Flutter JDK to Version 17**:

   - Flutter requires JDK 17 for Android development. Set the JDK path using the following command:
     ```bash
     flutter config --jdk-dir=<path/to/jdk17>
     ```
   - Example for Linux:
     ```bash
     flutter config --jdk-dir=/usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk
     ```
   - Example for Windows:
     ```bash
     flutter config --jdk-dir="C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-17"
     ```

3. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/akaMrNagar/Mindful.git && cd Mindful
   ```

4. **Get Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

5. **Generate Temporary Files**:
   ```bash
   dart run build_runner build -d
   ```

## Generating a Keystore

To build the app in release mode, you need a keystore. Follow these steps to generate one:

### For Linux/macOS:

1. Create a temporary directory inside the project:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p temp
   ```

2. Generate the keystore inside the `temp` folder:

   ```bash
   keytool -genkey -v -keystore temp/mindful.jks -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias mindful
   ```

   - You will be prompted to enter a **keystore password**, **key password**, and other details.

3. Set the keystore file permissions:
   ```bash
   chmod 600 temp/mindful.jks
   ```

### For Windows:

1. Create a temporary folder inside the project:

   ```batch
   mkdir temp
   ```

2. Generate the keystore inside the `temp` folder:
   ```batch
   keytool -genkey -v -keystore temp\mindful.jks -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias mindful
   ```
   - You will be prompted to enter a **keystore password**, **key password**, and other details.

## Setting Environment Variables

To use the keystore during the build process, set the following environment variables:

### For Linux/macOS:

1. Create a script file in `temp` (e.g., `temp/keystore.sh`):

   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash

   export KEYSTORE_FILE="$(pwd)/temp/mindful.jks"
   export STORE_PASSWORD="your_keystore_password"
   export KEY_ALIAS="mindful"
   export KEY_PASSWORD="your_key_password"

   echo "KEYSTORE_FILE: $KEYSTORE_FILE"
   echo "STORE_PASSWORD: $STORE_PASSWORD"
   echo "KEY_ALIAS: $KEY_ALIAS"
   echo "KEY_PASSWORD: $KEY_PASSWORD"
   ```

2. Make the script executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x temp/keystore.sh
   ```

3. Source the script before building the app:
   ```bash
   source temp/keystore.sh
   ```

### For Windows:

1. Create a batch file in `temp` (e.g., `temp/keystore.bat`):

   ```batch
   @echo off
   set KEYSTORE_FILE=%CD%\temp\mindful.jks
   set STORE_PASSWORD=your_keystore_password
   set KEY_ALIAS=mindful
   set KEY_PASSWORD=your_key_password

   echo KEYSTORE_FILE: %KEYSTORE_FILE%
   echo STORE_PASSWORD: %STORE_PASSWORD%
   echo KEY_ALIAS: %KEY_ALIAS%
   echo KEY_PASSWORD: %KEY_PASSWORD%
   ```

2. Run the batch file before building the app:
   ```batch
   temp\keystore.bat
   ```

**Note:** The `temp/` directory is ignored by Git to ensure sensitive files like keystores and environment scripts are not accidentally committed.

## Building the APK

1. Build the APK in release mode:

   ```bash
   flutter build apk --release
   ```

2. The APK will be generated at:
   ```
   build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk
   ```

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Missing `storeFile` Error**:
  Ensure the `KEYSTORE_FILE` environment variable is correctly set and points to a valid keystore file.

- **JDK Version Issues**:
  Verify that the JDK version is set to 17:

  ```bash
  flutter doctor -v
  ```

- **Environment Variables Not Available**:
  Ensure the environment variables are set in the same terminal where you run the build command.
