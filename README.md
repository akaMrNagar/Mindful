## Why We Developed Mindful ?

We were frustrated with our own excessive phone usage and the lack of privacy-friendly, free solutions that could help manage it. After finding no suitable app on the Play Store, we decided to create Mindful—an app that respects your privacy, is free to use, and offers the comprehensive features we needed to regain control of our digital lives.
